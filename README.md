The app relies on a running backend (go-client) to communicate with the blockchain and get information regarding the demo user. Building Blocks Fitness is a fictitious gym that offers fitness classes among other services. Its main collaborator/partner is a cooking academy, which allows it's users to win rewards for the gym, such as in this case, a free membership.
